I recently finished my Master’s degree in Cyber Security with distinction at Newcastle University, where I focused on computer security. Before that, I graduated with first-class honours in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering, also at Newcastle.

Along the way, I’ve developed a strong interest in cyber-physical systems, which has become a key focus of my research and something I’m really passionate about exploring further. These experiences have given me a solid foundation and a real enthusiasm for tackling the challenges in cyber security.
