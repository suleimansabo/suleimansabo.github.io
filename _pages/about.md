Hi, I'm **Suleiman Sabo**, a PhD researcher in **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Security** at **Newcastle University**, where I’m part of the [Secure and Resilient Systems (SRS) research group](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/srs/). My work focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and system security, particularly the real-time detection and classification of anomalies in industrial CPS environments.

I previously earned a **Distinction in MSc Cyber Security** and a **First-Class Honours in BSc Computer Science (Software Engineering)** from Newcastle University. My Master’s dissertation evaluated component-level versus system-level risk assessment strategies in CPS using the SWaT testbed and threat modeling techniques. My undergraduate research explored the use of digital signatures to address challenges related to **trust, usability, and accessibility in Nigeria's electronic voting systems**.

Currently, I’m exploring:
- AI-driven anomaly classification in CPS
- Adversarial machine learning and stealth attack profiling
- Real-time threat attribution and behavior modeling
- Model extraction and secure inference in distributed control environments
